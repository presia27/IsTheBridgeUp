# Is The Bridge Up?

A full stack web app and API that tells you which of Seattle's 7 moveable bridges are up at any given time.

Surrounded by several rivers and waterways, the City of Seattle has 3 moveable bridges spanning the Duwamish River (1st Ave S/SR99, Lower Spokane Street/Lower West Seattle Bridge, and the South Park Bridge), and 4 moveable bridges spanning the Lake Washington Ship Canal (Ballard, Fremont, University and Montlake bridges). These bridges carry motor vehicle, bike and pedestrian traffic above and open for boat traffic below.

Data for bridge openings is available from the Seattle Department of Transportation in a general traffic map. This project takes their API and focuses on the city's bridges, complete with live pictures and a more clearly documented API.
